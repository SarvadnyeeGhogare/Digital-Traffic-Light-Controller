# Digital-Traffic-Light-Controller
Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a traffic light controller for a two-way intersection using Verilog. The system prioritizes North-South traffic, ensuring smooth vehicle flow while allowing East-West vehicles to pass when necessary. The controller efficiently manages signal transitions based on predefined timing constraints.
